Hvordan får vi fat på data?
## Getting the data

This is not quite big data - we could do it in Excel.

But it is quite large data.

The dataset we are going to work with, contains 517401 emails. And the original
can be downloaded from:

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/

It needs to be unzipped and untarred, and then 517401 individual files need to 
be read in and organized in a way that we can work with it.

Will Cukierski have done that part, and published a CSV file on Kaggle. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset
We can download that. But it is still a 1.3 GB file.

In preparation for this course, we have cleaned it up, brought the filesize
down to 83.2 MB. Still a large file, but manageble.
